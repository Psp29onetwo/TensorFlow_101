### ðŸ›  00. TensorFlow Fundamentals Exercises

1. Create a vector, scalar, matrix and tensor with values of your choosing using `tf.constant()`.
2. Find the shape, rank and size of the tensors you created in 1.
3. Create two tensors containing random values between 0 and 1 with shape `[5, 300]`.
4. Multiply the two tensors you created in 3 using matrix multiplication.
5. Multiply the two tensors you created in 3 using dot product.
6. Create a tensor with random values between 0 and 1 with shape `[224, 224, 3]`.
7. Find the min and max values of the tensor you created in 6 along the first axis.
8. Created a tensor with random values of shape `[1, 224, 224, 3]` then squeeze it to change the shape to `[224, 224, 3]`.
9. Create a tensor with shape `[10]` using your own choice of values, then find the index which has the maximum value.

### ðŸ›  01. Neural network regression with TensorFlow Exercises

1. Create your own regression dataset (or make the one we created in "Create data to view and fit" bigger) and build fit a model to it.
2. Try building a neural network with 4 Dense layers and fitting it to your own regression dataset, how does it perform?
3. Try and improve the results we got on the insurance dataset, some things you might want to try include:
  * Building a larger model (how does one with 4 dense layers go?).
  * Increasing the number of units in each layer.
  * Lookup the documentation of [Adam](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam) and find out what the first parameter is, what happens if you increase it by 10x?
  * What happens if you train for longer (say 300 epochs instead of 200)? 
4. Import the [Boston pricing dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/boston_housing/load_data) from TensorFlow [`tf.keras.datasets`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets) and model it.
